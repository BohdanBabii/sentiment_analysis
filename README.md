# Sentiment Analysis (Final Project for Statistical Learning Theory LAB)

## Files

- [`data.csv`](data.csv) contains labels and tweets you can use to train your model (it is useful to split this into your own train/test data)
- [`data_validation.csv`](data_validation.csv) contains tweets that are used to evaluate your model on [the evaluation side](http://ti2.pythonanywhere.com/)
- [`literature/`](literature/) contains various literature around sentiment analysis
  - [`literature/an_analysis_of_sentiment.pdf`](literature/an_analysis_of_sentiment.pdf) and
  - [`literature/survey_on_sentiment_analysis.pdf`](literature/survey_on_sentiment_analysis.pdf) are broad overviews on the topic, while the others describe more specific techniques
- [`report_template/`](report_template/) contains a template for a project report written in LaTeX. If you think it is ugly, you can also use your own template (or you can use Word but you'll have to do the formatting yourself).
- [`evaluation_rubric.pdf`](evaluation_rubric.pdf) contains criteria that we will use to grade your project report. This should serve as a guide on what to do with your report.

## Deadlines

The project report is due 19th of August 2024. You will get an email about possible dates for your oral exam. Generally we need about one week to look into your project before the oral exam.
